# CameraButton
A simple proof of concept program that makes use of the web cam as an additional "safe" button. In combination with autohotkey it makes for a semi-secure password.

Working "Camera button" program. The c++ files have to be compiled(or the binaries can be used in case you don't want to fiddle with OpenCV), and the autohotkey script has to be run.
If you want it to be active after every restart, you have to set the paths to the full paths of the binaries, and compile the AHK script, after which you have to place it to the Startup folder in Appdata
